In the annals of Aelorian history, a profound revelation has reshaped their understanding of their origins. Millions of years past, the Aelorians, in a radically different form, were not native denizens of Aeloria but instead an engineered slave race. These early Aelorians were compact, adaptable beings, designed to serve an enigmatic and long-vanished civilization or species.

Aeloria, despite its potential for life, had remained barren until the intervention of this mysterious advanced civilization. They introduced these early Aelorians to the planet as part of their ambitious efforts to colonize and catalyze the planet's biological growth.

However, the sands of time have obscured the fate of the masters who initiated this grand design. Whether they perished or abandoned the planet is a question that remains unanswered. What endures from this ancient legacy is the transformation of the Aelorians themselves, as well as remnants of their masters technology.

Over the eons, the Aelorians evolved alingside their now growing planet, adapting to their unique environment. The absence of sodium, a fundamental element for many life forms, compelled them to develop alternative mechanisms, relying on potassium and calcium to power their cellular, tissue, and nervous processes.

Notably, remnants of the master civilization's technology, previously concealed for eons, have been discovered in recent explorations within Aeloria's jungles and mountains. This discovery has catalyzed a systematic effort to reverse engineer these artifacts. The results have been noteworthy, with a discernible upturn in Aelorian technological capabilities.

In regions once untouched by the hand of progress, research facilities now thrive, dedicated to unlocking the secrets of these ancient remnants. The synergy between historical knowledge and contemporary scientific methodology has yielded tangible technological advancements. As Aelorians decode these long-buried puzzles, they chart a trajectory of continued progress and adaptability, positioning themselves as adept members within the broader galactic community.
