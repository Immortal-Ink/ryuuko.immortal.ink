Aeloria's legal system is characterized by a restorative justice model. This system emphasizes repairing harm caused by criminal behavior rather than punitive measures. Social networks play a crucial role, focusing on community involvement in resolving conflicts. The legal code is structured around this restorative approach, detailing processes for resolution. Cases are mediated collaboratively, involving both the victim and the offender. The legal code is public and accessible, promoting transparency. Aeloria has moved away from traditional adversarial systems, creating a unique legal framework that aligns with its societal values and fosters community harmony.
