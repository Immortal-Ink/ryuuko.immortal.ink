~~I. The Nightmare of Hollow Wings
"When wings are stripped of feathers and hollow bones fall, the sky remembers and reclaims its own."
There is a time when all flight must end, when the air we once commanded is taken from us. Even the proudest flight is but a brief intrusion upon the vastness of the sky.~~

- Alt I. The Nightmare of the Empty Sky
"When wings fall and feathers burn, the sky reclaims its own. Even the proudest flight leaves no mark, for the endless sky is a void that neither mourns nor remembers."
All that rises must one day descend, and even the loftiest soar leaves no trace. The sky remains vast and indifferent, swallowing all flights without a whisper of what once was.
(Nothing Matters)

II. The Nightmare of Endless Molt
"Feathers are shed, layer by layer, until nothing remains but a bare and silent form, waiting to be dust."
We are reborn only to shed ourselves again, losing what we once were. In each cycle, pieces of us scatter to the winds, and nothing is carried into eternity unaltered.
(Existence is a transformative process for all things, and to eachother.)

---

III. The Nightmare of the Forsaken Nest
"Nests rot and crumble, abandoned by the winged and unwatched by the stars."
All shelters must collapse. What once held warmth and life will one day be forgotten. Even the strongest foundations fall to dust and silence.
(All things built must fall back down)

---

IV. The Nightmare of the Blinding Sun
"When the light grows too fierce, feathers burn, and shadows are erased."
The same light that gives us strength can consume us, erasing us in a blaze of harsh truth. The beauty of light is also its terror, for nothing withstands its final, burning gaze.
(All things, even the stars and eternal flame, in moderation.)

---

V. The Nightmare of the Black Sky
"When the stars abandon their vigil, only darkness fills the wings."
We soar by the guidance of stars, yet they, too, fade. There will come a night with no light to guide us, a descent into unending shadow where no direction can be found.
(To seek knowledge too far, is the creation of madness, a black sky can no longer be read.)

---

VI. The Nightmare of the Broken Flock
"Each bird is destined to stray, and each flock to shatter under the weight of the sky."
Even in unity, we are fragile. Companionship is fleeting; each must eventually fly alone, for no gathering can outlast the endless march of time.
(We die alone)

---

VII. The Nightmare of the Feathered Ghosts
"Those who once soared haunt the currents, unseen but felt in the chill of the wind."
The past clings to us, yet it cannot be seen. The spirits of those before us are no comfort, only reminders of what will become of usâ€”a cold presence lingering, invisible yet inescapable.
(Why cling to those we lost when we ourselves will also be lost)

---

~~VIII. The Nightmare of the Eternal Sky
"When all wings cease to beat, the sky remains, vast and indifferent, a void that neither welcomes nor mourns."
In the end, the sky is endless and uncaring. We leave no mark upon its vastness, no legacy but the silence of our absence. The cycle goes on, but without us, untouched by our passing.~~

- Alt VIII. The Nightmare of the Silent Dawn
"When the world waits and no song greets the morning, the silence is deafening, for even the chorus must one day end."
There will come a time when no voice breaks the dawn, when all songs fade to silence. In that stillness, the emptiness is absolute, a reminder that all life, too, must fall to quiet in the end.
(Entropy is a bitch)

~~- Alt VIII. The Nightmare of the Shadowed Cycle
"When the wheel turns upon itself and consumes its own spokes, the path collapses, and the cycle finds its end."
Even cycles are not immune to decay. The repetition that holds the universe together must one day falter, leaving behind only the void where patterns once flowed.~~
