In sorrow's realm, where shadows creep,
Death appears with whispers deep.
Guiding hearts in grief's cruel grasp,
A cosmic dance in shadows clasped.

Marked on skin, etched by despair,
Goals unfold, a journey rare.
Personal quests, life's tapestry,
A path to joy, from agony free.

Each mark a goal, a life's decree,
Guided by Death, in destiny.
The last, a promise, reunion's sign,
Yet hidden truths in paths entwine.

As marks dissolve, burdens lift,
Grief's weight, a subtle shift.
A tale unfolds of myths untold,
Death, companion, compassionate and bold.

Fulfill these quests, embrace life's grace,
In Death's dance, a tranquil space.
A fulfilled end, a soul set free,
Guided to reunion, eternally.

In Aelorian society, Death in the form of a young girl, serves as a guide for fulfilled souls to the afterlife. She cannot guide those who died with a heavy soul, anchored to Aeloria as an ancestral spirit to teach their future generations in hopes they avoid the same life path.

Death takes a special interest in those who experience great grief having lost a loved one who died happy and fulfilled. Especially when that grief risks weighing themselves down and preventing them from moving on themselves.

Myths and poems depict death appearing before such troubled souls, and peering into the infinite life paths within the shadow in their hearts, marks them (interpretations vary, but some depict this as tattoos upon the body, others depict this as marks upon the heart) with goals or challenges, leading up to the promise they can be reunited with their lost loved one. It is a trick, the seemingly unimportant tasks take a lifetime to achieve, and cause fulfilling life moments, as each goal is completed, the mark fades away, and takes some grief or shadow from the soul with it.

After living a long and fulfilled life, they die happy, and Death can guide them to their lost beloved in the afterlife. Fulfilling the visions she gave them in the beginning, a promise from death to the broken.
