In sorrow's realm, where shadows creep,
Death appears with whispers deep.
Guiding hearts in grief's cruel grasp,
A cosmic dance in shadows clasped.

Marked on skin, etched by despair,
Goals unfold, a journey rare.
Personal quests, life's tapestry,
A path to joy, from agony free.

Each mark a goal, a life's decree,
Guided by Death, in destiny.
The last, a promise, reunion's sign,
Yet hidden truths in paths entwine.

As marks dissolve, burdens lift,
Grief's weight, a subtle shift.
A tale unfolds of myths untold,
Death, companion, compassionate and bold.

Fulfill these quests, embrace life's grace,
In Death's dance, a tranquil space.
A fulfilled end, a soul set free,
Guided to reunion, eternally.

In Aelorian society, Death is a guide for fulfilled souls, and depicted as a small girl, who sees in the shadows of your heart, a million possible life paths. A common appearence in their mythology is Death as someone who takes interest in the living who have lost a deeply loved one, and in their grief may loose themselves. Death will appear before the grieving, and present them with a series of challenges, or goals, the final goal depicting the grieving being reunited with their lost loved one. Death can only guide those who die fulfilled. If unfulfilled at death, the soul is stuck on Aeloria as an ancestral spirit, to guide their future generations in avoiding a similar fate. Death tricks the individual seemingly with the promise of returning the lost loved one, the reality is the goals or challenges depicted, historically embedded as a tapestry or marks upon their feathers or their hearts (various interpretations exist) will guide the individual down a happy and fulfilled life, when achieving these goals or meeting these challenges, the mark or tattoo dissapears, and takes some grief with it, like a little more weight off the soul. And finally, when they die after a long and fulfilled life, having completd all the goals, and having lifted the weight of grief of their soul completely, death can guide them to their lost loved one to be together forever in the afterlife.
