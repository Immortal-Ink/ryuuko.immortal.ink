Various biology decision shave been made for the aelorian species to cater to various story and worldbuilding elements.

# Wings
## Skeletal
Specifically the wing-arm hybrid limb has been planned out and checked with an osteologist so that we can properly describe the mechanical movements involved with the species wings especially needed for modeling and rigging the 3D character assets.

The wing extends outward away from the body on either side with a highly extended pisiform as follows:

The pisiform was extended rather then mounting feathers directly to the arm alone as flight puts the wing under a great deal of stress, an extended bone provides greater strength and control to the primaries. 

The pisiform folds inwards ulnawards

## Musculature
The pectoral, rotator cuff, deltoid and latissimus dorsi muscles are most important for allowing the humanoid body to still have useful maneuverable flight. As such, strong flyers will have exaggerated shoulder and pectoral muscles.
