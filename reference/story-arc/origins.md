Origins focuses on not the backstory of the viper lab, but the characters involved in creating ryuuko. Its main purpose is to worldbuild the government, science, and religion of the society, as well as introduce key characters like scientists, and government officials involved in the project, setting up each individuals plot twist or character development arc. The comic ends right before they boot up the final revision of ryuuko.

## Scene 1 - Auditor's Office - Ground
Short Flashback of Wrenna childhood. Showcase a bright and curious mind with childlike wonder. Use this scene to worldbuild a dystopian society, things are not well maintained, The Ground of Innovation is a toxic slum, where the garbage and scraps from Innovations top departments provide the primary resource for those without government positions. Here, have a scene where as a child, she does something brave that saves someone else from some minor event or issue that could have harmed them.

Flashback interrupted, her attention snapped back to the present by someone calling her name. She is at a budget review meeting and is being grilled by a goverment higherup. As the the Chief of Robotics under the Director of the Ministry of Innovation she is currently fighting for more budget and resources for a project that was requested by the Ministry of Peace. 

While discussing the detaiuls of Wrennas request for more resources for cobras new project, show dark shots of the labs with wrenna and coworkers working on ryuuko, while wrenna describes the work as incredibly important to the auditors board.

The goverment auditor is demanding more details about the project. Wrenna stonewalls, claiming the information is classified but she clearly has the official paperwork sanctioning the project, as well as a memo from the Director (of the MOP) requesting the additional resources, and that it would be sufficient. The auditor reluctantly approves the budget.

## Scene 2
At some point Wrenna should step out to The Ground where we show that society's undesireables reside in less-than-ideal circumstances. However, The Ground is in much better condition then we see in Wrennas flashback, something she seems to take pride in. Direct her attention to the same location where she saved someone else as a kid, matching the frame exactly, showing how much better the location is now maintained and looks.
> Distastefully and simply called "The Ground", the lower half of most Aelorian cities are dedicated to the infrastructure required to run the city, such as waste, energy, etc. The Ground is the home of criminals, sick, elderly and disabled, and is not maintained anywhere near as well as the cities themselves. This creates a natural class system with the wealthy/healthy above and the sick and accused below.

## Scene 
Need to plan out a scene where we can challenge her morals and let her take a stance on where her morals are.

## Scene 
A scene where she actually works on Ryuuko without showing Ryuuko. Should use this scene to develope her relationship with her staff. We should show a couple of co-workers with very close positive relationships who are all passionate about the project, and at least one co-worker who has distaste for the project, but loyalty to their boss.

# Notes
Id like to incorporate a traumatic childhood event for Wrenna, but not immediatly, to much flashback feels overwhelming. I'm thinking of getting to it in the second comic.
