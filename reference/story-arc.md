# Ryuuko Comics

## Origins
- [Origins Storyboarding](/reference/story-arc/origins)
{.links-list}

Origins focuses on not the backstory of the viper lab, but the characters involved in creating ryuuko. Its main purpose is to worldbuild the government, science, and religion of the society, as well as introduce key characters like scientists, and government officials involved in the project, setting up each individuals plot twist or character development arc. The comic ends right before they boot up the final revision of ryuuko.

## Awakening
- [Awakening Storyboarding](/reference/story-arc/awakening)
{.links-list}

Awakening starts with the laboratory starting up the production ryuuko unit. The laboratory takes artema through various system checks and tests, giving us the oppurtunity to define the main characters abilities and shortcomings, and give us an introduction to her personality in this early state. The main characters personality starts naive and obiedient. Her attitude is uncaring, cold, calculating, and efficent. She believes what she and the audience are told about her purpose, and why and how she was created. These reasons are false, and will be a central plot twist later in the storyline. This comic also gives ryuukos creators and her a chance to get a feel for eachother, concrete the foundation of their relationship, etc. For example by having a discussion while they do physical tests with ryuuko plugged into a console as the lead engineer works on it.

Potentially include initial government discovery, and provide foreshaddowing for the initial conflict between the main character, her creators, and the government.

## Countermeasure
- [Countermeasure Storyboarding](/reference/story-arc/countermeasure)
{.links-list}

The objective of counermeasure is to set up the main characters perceptions about her intended purpose, and show how the brewing conflict causes her to question the truthfulness of her creators about her purpose and creation. The comic has her start/complete a mission of some sort that would be dangerous and nearly impossible for a trained military team, but isnt a challenge for the main character. If the mission ends up being an assasination, potentially build character by learning truths about the target she wasnt informed of, causing her to question the governments objective to have the target killed, and resulting in her not doing the mission, and coming to the conclusion that she needs to run. The target should in this case, communicate the distrust in the government AND her creators that the general society is currently feeling. And that can trigger alot of the initial self reflection.

## Taking Flight
- [Taking Flight Storyboarding](/reference/story-arc/taking-flight)
{.links-list}

Taking flight is ryuukos escape from either her home planet, to a mining colony planet in the star system. Use this comic to explore her true to self personality, as well as worldbuild MUCH more about the nation she was created by, and then the surrounding planets, species, and culture. Countermeasure should have the main character look for work to assist in escaping farther, and getting tangled up with some form of less then ideal work that provides a platform to throw problems at her that challenges her initially installed opinions on things. She meets vatuus character, who seeing her desperation offers anything she wants in exchange for completing a impossible theft for him. The comic ends on her sending a message to vatuus character, and recieving a response of only coordinates.

## Contact
- [Contact Storyboarding](/reference/story-arc/contact)
{.links-list}

The main character meets vatuus character at his base, and completes a mission to steal a valuable artifact for them from a collector, who has the best security system in the galaxy, Ryuuko is damaged after the encounter, resulting in her using her self repair functionality, which attunes the nanites (what vatuu called an artifact was actually un attuned nanites from his culture) to her person, preventing others from using them. After discovering this, vatuu attempts to kill ryuuko to remove her resonator which controls the nanites, resulting in ryuko learning how to control thenanites specifically to summon her swords out of nanites, unlocking that ability for the rest of the series. In doing so, she enrages vatuu, who in their anger makes enough mistakes to allow ryuuko to escape, setting up another villain. And now she doesnt have to carry her swords on her back.

# Misc details and story bits
The lab does military and defense research for the bird society, its branded after a cobra head as a bit of irony regarding the relationship birds and snakes have in our world. The primary secret objective of the lab is the creation of ryuuko.

The project is codenamed V.I.P.E.R. which stands for Versatile Infiltration and Precision Elimination Robot. 

Ryuuko is named after the fact she is the winged offspring of project viper. A winged danger noodle isa eastern culture dragon. So Ryuuko is a female japanese name for "Dragon Child". or 竜子 Ryuuko would technically be Ryuko or Ryūko. However I added an additional u to avoid clashing with the Kill la Kill character. 

The logo of the lab, and project viper is a minimalistic snake head, and also a shield. ![viper.svg](/branding/viper.svg =20x)

Ryuuko starts pretty obedient and mindless. She follows orders. SO the story focuses on other aspects of the world, such as the main secret antagonist, the lead engineer/scientist on the viper project. As she begins to question whats going on, she develops intellectually, and emotionally quickly through the story. Which is exactly why her level of ai was previuously outlawed.
