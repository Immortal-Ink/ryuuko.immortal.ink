Home to the anthropromorphic avian race, the Aelorian.
# Planetary Material and Composition
The planet has overall an incredibly low sodium and sodium ion presence. This results in a number of interesting ecosystems and biological processes. 

The upper crust of the planet has very little:
- Sodium
- Chlorine (commonly found in salt compounds)
- Magnesium (commonly found in minerals associated with salt deposits)
- Iodine
- Strontium
- Bromine.

However, the planet has much higher quantities of:
- Aluminum (as the absence of extensive saltwater bodies would reduce the corrosion of aluminum-based materials.)
- Iron (for the same reason as aluminum)
- Copper
- Silicon
- Titanium (Highly valued for its low density and strength on Aeloria)
- Precious Metals (Much more abundant)
- Cobalt

## Oceans and Water
 Aeloria is a "Freshwater Hydrosphere", covered mostly in shallow freshwater oceans. Landmass tends to be large basins, creating rings of cliffs, topped by mountain ranges or plateaus. Such geological features isolate its water bodies from the influences that typically introduce salts into water via many enclosed basins with limited inflow and outflow. The planet's composition, including its rocks and minerals, also naturally have a low salt content. This means that even as water interacts with these materials, it picks up fewer salts. The planet also experiences intense and continuous precipitation, creating vast amounts of freshwater runoff into lakes and rivers on what landmass is available. This dilutes any salts or minerals in the water, keeping it mostly fresh.
 
## Mountains and landmasses
The overall surface is covered in almost cell like basins consisting of ring shaped mountains and flatter landmass seperating massive bowled oceans. The mountains consist mostly of silicate and carbonite rocks, resulting in bright white almost sparkly surfaces due to high quartz and silica content, or dark black ranges and landmasses. Gigantic towering crystaline formations are also scatered around the planet.

As tectonic acitivity pushed these crystalline masses up, the mountain ranges picked up large sheets of ore deposited in the crust, resulting in large colorful bands in the otherwise stark white mountains.

# Flora and Fauna
The planets biodiversity has unique biological processes due to the lack of sodium compared to most other planets in the galaxy. Flora on Aeloria is mostly the same as it is anywhere else. Plant life tends to be green, as the lack of sodium has litle impact on the presence of chlorophyll.

## Potassium-Based Osmotic Regulation
Osmotic balance is essential for the survival of any organism. On Aeloria, species rely more heavily on potassium ions (K+) for osmotic regulation. Potassium replaces sodium in maintaining the balance of water and ions within their cells and tissues. Species also have specialized transport mechanisms to absorb and excrete potassium efficiently.

## Muscle Contraction
Sodium plays a critical role in initiating muscle contractions by allowing nerve signals to trigger the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) within muscle cells. On Aeloria, species adapted their neuromuscular systems to utilize alternative ions, such as calcium and potassium, for muscle contraction. These adaptations involved differences in ion channel sensitivity and the development of specialized muscle proteins.

## Nerve Function
Sodium ions are crucial for the generation and propagation of nerve impulses. Aelorian species have evolved alternative ion channels and signaling pathways to maintain nerve function without sodium. Calcium and potassium play the prominent role in mediating nerve impulses.

## Evolved Sensory Systems
Sodium is involved in taste perception in many organisms. Aelorian species have evolved taste receptors that are sensitive to non-sodium flavors, allowing them to detect and evaluate the nutrient content of foods without relying on salty tastes. This has also resulted in a general intolerance to sodium. Aelorians Will avoid salty foods as they cannot taste the sodium, and it upsets their digestive systems. Instead prefering grain and fruity tastes and diets.

# Planetary Conditions

Aeloria boasts a stable climate, characterized by mild seasonal temperature variations owing to its low axial tilt. Large equatorial oceans facilitate consistent rainfall along the equator, while polar caps grace the distant opposite ends from the planet's axis. The planet has entered a seemingly permanant period of tectonic inactivity, with the cessation of tectonic movement around 2.4 million years ago. Notably, the Aelorian bird race has inhabited Aeloria for roughly 800,000 years.

Spanning a radius of approximately 3167.04 miles, Aeloria's geological history is marked by a unique development. Early volcanic activity played a pivotal role in cooling the planet's surface and initiating a process that generated high-pressure conditions within the planet's core. This elevated pressure facilitated the formation of a distinctive crystalline layer, primarily composed of carbon-rich silicate materials. Over time, this crystalline layer expanded and eventually pushed outward, forming the iconic quartz silicate mountain ranges that define Aeloria's landscape.

Aeloria is a celestial anomaly, orbiting an exceptionally radiant and tranquil red dwarf star, which emits approximately 4.2306 Ã— 10^26 watts of luminosity. This stellar companion, characterized by its brightness and serene nature, is a rarity in the cosmos. Moreover, Aeloria boasts a set of planetary rings, an astronomical feature that emerged roughly 80,000 years ago. These rings originated from the remnants of an ancient civilization's protective shield, which disintegrated due to a series of colossal meteor impacts. Notably, these rings exhibit counter-rotational motion relative to the planet's spin, ensuring their extended longevity. The Aelorians, however, have witnessed minimal alterations to their planetary environment, and it's important to clarify that the volcanic activity didn't initiate cooling; rather, the cooling process arose as a consequence of decreased volcanic eruptions, subsequently leading to the formation of the high-pressure crystalline layer.
